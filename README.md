**The task is to work with two datasets by performing a series of data analysis steps.** This includes importing the data files, examining their contents, verifying and correcting data types as needed, and identifying the top 10 neighborhoods based on the number of drop-offs.

The analysis also requires the creation of visualizations, such as:

* A graph showing the number of rides per taxi company
* A graph highlighting the top 10 neighborhoods by number of drop-offs

For each graph produced, conclusions should be drawn and the results explained clearly.
